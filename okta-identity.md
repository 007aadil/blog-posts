## 🔑 Key Features of Okta Identity

### **1. Single Sign-On (SSO)**
Okta allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.  
This improves both user convenience and security.

### **2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Okta supports multiple types of MFA such as:
- OTP  
- Push notifications  
- Biometrics
